		<p>AAn experimental Chrome extension for CS193c. This extension will grab
		the compose box when you are in Gmail and will automatically inject some
		text and image (easily changeable in the source) into the frame.

		Basically, it is an automatic signature. The challenge is mainly in
		traversing the Gmail DOM. The effort in traversing and manipulating the
		DOM can be used as a foundation to build some interesting Chrome Gmail
		extensions.</p>

		<p>The published Chrome extension can be found here<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pedjahgfjoclaokklamllhfhgdnkhfbf">here</a>
